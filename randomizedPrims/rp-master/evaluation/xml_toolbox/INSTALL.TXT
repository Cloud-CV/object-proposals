The XML Toolbox for Matlab provides easy-to-use XML functionality 
to the Matlab environment. It has been tested with Matlab versions 
6.5 (R13) and 7 (R14). It can be used standalone and does not 
require Java.

---------------------------
 Installation Instructions
---------------------------

Unzip the files from the XMLToolbox.zip file. This creates a 
subfolder named "xml_toolbox".

This new directory containing .m and .p files should be added 
to the Matlab search path. This can be done by either of...

(1) If using the Matlab desktop, navigate to the 'Set Path' dialog 
 ('File' > 'Set Path'). Click the 'Add Folder' button and browse 
 to the directory containing the XML Toolbox, select 'OK' to 
 confirm. You may wish to click the 'Save' button to preserve 
 the configuration between sessions. Click 'Close' to dismiss 
 the dialog.

(2) If you are using Matlab via the Unix terminal you can instead 
 use the 'addpath' and 'savepath' functions at the Matlab command 
 line. 
     >> addpath /home/USER/GeodiseLab/XMLToolbox

(3) System administrators configuring a multi-user Matlab installation 
 may find it preferable to edit $MATLABROOT/toolbox/local/pathdef.m 
 to make changes to the Matlab search path available to all users.

To confirm that the Matlab search path has been successfully 
configured type the following (without the >>) and press Return:
    >> str = which('xml_help')
The variable str should contain the path of the XML Toolbox.

---------------------------
 Test the Installation
---------------------------

To test the installation, type "xml_help" at the Matlab prompt. 
This should display a short description of the functions in the 
XML Toolbox. Each function is easy to use and contains its own 
help (available with ">> help xml_xxxx"). 
Try now to execute the following at the Matlab command prompt:  

>> xml_help
>> xml_format( 'Hello World!' ) 
>>  
>> str = xml_format(17.29) 
>> a = xml_parse(str) 

As an alternative test and example, try the xml_tests script in the 
tests subdirectory.
